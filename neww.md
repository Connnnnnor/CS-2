What is Life.....in Computer Science like?

The word I would use to describe Computer Science is mello. I rarely feel stressed in this class, I feel like it's very much like real life, in the way that you (Mr. Wegscheid) have a stack of things on your desk and throughout the day we have to work to get rid of that stack. I don’t know if that’s exactly how a real life office works, but it feels real so I’m just gonna run with it. I don't know if I will use python in the future. but if I will, this class would be semi-useful, depending on how much of the material I forget. I will admit that I'm not the best coder and that coding is just not my thing, but I hope I can one day become okay at it.
